			<h2>Sausages Face</h2>
			<p>Sausages Face my greatly but gently butler, has taken his own self from this mortal coil; alas, I fed him not in the prior fortnight, 
		perhaps some guilt remains. My gentle fed well despite not being bred in me from the origin, so nurture provides always, but less so for ill-mannered butlers who buttle poorly. 
		But what does this mean for rabbit-haven royalters, except potato? I am starting to suspect that nobody will ever know. Let us mourn this fact along with the demise of said ill-fated cohort.</p>

			<h2 id="puttymo">Puttymo</h2>
			<p>Given that over forty and a one months time have passed since the Chalk Farm fiasco, I have recently felt the compulsion and possibly the desire, and maybe even the urge if you will, to look into maybe taking up some new form of semi-employment.
				<br> As those of you know me well will know quite well or even weller, I am a man who likes to keep busy, and must at all times be using my hands for constructive purposes. Bad things have happened when I have become distracted or bored. For example
				I once knitted a badger to its own mind over a particularly quiet bank holiday weekend.
				<br> I have spent over twoty or threety years and thirty emblems at reed; it was there I first learnt to communicate solely with my eyebrows, how to make socks from road kill, and how to become employed through a care in the community program without
				anyone actually finding out about my uni-bottocked situation or my brain spoon.
				<br> For these reasons I have become quite attached to the place and thus it was quite a difficult decision to actually leave. I felt like a very handsome blister being suddenly ripped from its host.

			<h2 id="wren">Farming chalk</h2>
			<p>I was offered a position, namely that of chalk farmer. Chalk supplies in London are very low at the moment, due to a lack of natural predators, apparently (I was confused at this point). I accepted immediately.<br>
			Interestingly it was at a small to medium sounding farm in the Chalk Farm area.
			I had always wanted to farm chalk at a chalk farm in chalk farm. But I was very concerned that should anyone ask me what I did for a living
			it would sound faintly ridiculous.
			So I killed myself and set fire to the body fourteen times, to make sure no one found the evidence.<br> 
			I didn't apologise the recruiterment consulterant so I will probably remain in limbo for eternity like Universal Healthcare.<br><br>

			<h2 id="custard">Advert</h2>
			<p>Can you test that all of our custard is thick enough to meet our high standards?<Br><Br>
			By that I mean you should not be able to swim in it even if you are really really strong, like a carbon fiber whiskey.<Br><Br>
			When I was a boy, I often dreamt of working in a custard factory. Imagine, I thought to myself during one of my wetter childish reveries, imagine if I could actually walk about in a place that makes my favourite yellow non-newtonian liquid-based dessert. I would probably either die of happy, or just be quite pleased for a while until I realised it was a fruitless* dream and then moved on to the trifle factory down the road. (ha)<Br><Br>
			Either way, Imagine! I reveried. I reveried hard. Harder than anyone else of that era, to my knowledge.<Br>
			Today, that dream has come true. And even though you should never start a sentence with And, I want to share that never ending joy with you, an unemployed custard-ignoring fiend.<Br><Br>
			Imagine!
